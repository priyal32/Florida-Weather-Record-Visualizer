# Florida-Weather-Record-Visualizer
Collaborated with mirasaldanha

This program is made by Jupyter Notebook and python along with python and python libraries of matplotlib, and pandas. Temperature data of Florida over the last 
decade is collected and then converted to json files to be read through python. The user can input the year or the month and 
year to see the temperature changes over a certain region displayed through graphs. The user can also get the minimum or maximum temperature of that year
over a region.
